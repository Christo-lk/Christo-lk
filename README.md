ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christo. I'm an Audio Engineer turned Full Stack Software Developer.

I am a creator and whether Iâ€™m writing code, playing in bands, or producing music, I feel my best when I am making something. 
    
My Stack includes JavaScript, HTML, Css (including frameworks such as Bulma, SASS and Tailwind), React, Redux, and Sqlite3. 
I'm currently exploring NextJS as well as deepening my understanding of MySql.
    
Here you can find a few of the projects I've been working on: 
    
- DevPortfolio: 

  https://github.com/harakeke-2021/DevPortfolio
    
  This was my final project that I built with 3 of my classmates in the final week of Enspiral Dev Academy's software development bootcamp. 
  The goal of the website was to build a platform where developers could showcase their portfolios in a sleek and user friendly website, whist also aiding employers
  in finding the right developer for the job they need done. 
  My role within this project was UI/UX lead. I designed the user interface and styling of the website to be sleek, and modern, with minimal colours using TailwindCss. 
    
- Db Audio Player: 

  https://github.com/Christo-lk/DbAudioPlayer
  
  This is a fun side Project where I am building an Audio Player using React and TailwindCss for the front end, Redux to manage application state, and Sqlite3 to store the songs   and metadata. 
  I am using Webpack as a bundler and Express paired with superAgent to run my local server and make API calls. 
  I am using this project as a workout to practise the tech that I know as well as pushing myself to implement more advanced functionality I have yet to learn.   
  
- The Breakfast Club
  
  https://github.com/Christo-lk/breakfast
  
  This was a project I built with a few of my classmates in the space of one Friday. 
  Its an app where users can select the ingredients they have available to them, then our App will search our database and send back recipes that include the 
  ingredients the user selected. 
  Yum!
